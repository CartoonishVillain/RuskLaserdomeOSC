### Rusk Laserdome OSC

This is a module that reimplments the laserdome avatar functionality of LD/Dead and LD/Team for those who want to continue using the interactive elements on their avatars.

This module currently works for Laserdome 1 but not Laserdome 2. If Cirrex uses the same logging schema in Laserdome 2 later it will connect fine, otherwise I'll patch it later. But for  now it's not possible from my end.

This module depends on VRCOSC, found here: https://vrcosc.com/

We also have a test world here, if you don't want to pool folks together to test in a live arena: https://vrchat.com/home/world/wrld_3b191e33-5262-444c-9259-d6d3a6beb5fc/info

Feel free to compile it as a VRCOSC module yourself, or you can install it by:
Todo: Make proper installation steps.
